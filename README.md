separately from the HQ (Dhanmondi) network.
Being a small network, the company has the following requirements during implementation;
1) One router and one switch to be used (all CISCO products).
b) 3 departments (IT, HR and Student service)
c) Each department is required to be in different VLANS.
2) Each department is required to have wireless network for the users.
3) Host devices in the network are required to obtain IPv4 address automatically.
4) Devices in all the departments are required to communicate with each other.
Assume the ISP gave out a base network of 192.168.10.0, you as the Fresher network engineer who has been
hired, design and implement a network considering the above requirements.
